# onPrepareSupportNavigateUpTaskStack

[androidJvm]\
open fun [onPrepareSupportNavigateUpTaskStack](on-prepare-support-navigate-up-task-stack.md)(@[NonNull](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/annotation/NonNull.html)builder: [TaskStackBuilder](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/core/app/TaskStackBuilder.html))

Support version of [onPrepareNavigateUpTaskStack](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/app/Activity.html#onpreparenavigateuptaskstack). This method will be called on all platform versions. 

 Prepare the synthetic task stack that will be generated during Up navigation from a different task. 

This method receives the [TaskStackBuilder](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/core/app/TaskStackBuilder.html) with the constructed series of Intents as generated by [onCreateSupportNavigateUpTaskStack](on-create-support-navigate-up-task-stack.md). If any extra data should be added to these intents before launching the new task, the application should override this method and add that data here.

#### Parameters
